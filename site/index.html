    <body_head>Hello,</body_head>
    
    <body_txt>
            <p>My name is Victoria Stauffer. I am a second-year student at Drexel University, enrolled in the Interactive Digital Media program.  So far my interests for this major lie in creative problem solving and in the psychological research contributing to UI and UX Design.</p>
            <p>Outside of this major I'm interested in environmentalism and sustainable living, as well as politics and sociology. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel very passionate about developing an informed perspective that considers more than just my personal experience.</p>
            <p>As a hobby, I love to draw and paint. I have been practicing fine art since high school and it's one of the things that drew me to the IDM program.</p>
            <p>I stay active with Yoga and Swing Dancing, and I like to challenge myself by finding the most ridiculous thing in a thrift store and buying it. I love wearing bright colors and patterns. It's something I think is overlooked by popular trends.</p>
            <p>I always feel that it's a challenge to describe yourself, so here are some random tidbits you can frame me with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I love peanut butter - crunchy and smooth</li>
            <li>My friends have described me as "awkward, but in an endearing way."</li>
            <li>My personal motto is "organized chaos," but with an emphasis on organized.</li>
        </ul>
